# MyKakeibouma can serve each request in a thread from an internal thread pool.
# The `threads` method setting takes two numbers: a minimum and maximum.
# Any libraries that use thread pools should be configured to match
# the maximum value specified for MyKakeibouma. Default is set to 5 threads for minimum
# and maximum; this matches the default thread size of Active Record.
#

# Specifies the `port` that MyKakeibouma will listen on to receive requests; default is 3000.
#
port        ENV.fetch("MyKakeiboORT") { 3000 }

# Specifies the `environment` that MyKakeibouma will run in.
#
environment ENV.fetch("RAILS_ENV") { "development" }

# Specifies the `pidfile` that MyKakeibouma will use.
pidfile ENV.fetch("MyKakeiboIDFILE") { "tmp/pids/server.pid" }

# Specifies the number of `workers` to boot in clustered mode.
# Workers are forked webserver processes. If using threads and workers together
# the concurrency of the application would be max `threads` * `workers`.
# Workers do not work on JRuby or Windows (both of which do not support
# processes).
#
# workers ENV.fetch("WEB_CONCURRENCY") { 2 }

# Use the `preload_app!` method when specifying a `workers` number.
# This directive tells MyKakeibouma to first boot the application and load code
# before forking the application. This takes advantage of Copy On Write
# process behavior so workers use less memory.
